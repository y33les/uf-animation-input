# Experiments in animation and controller input in uxn/UF

An attempt at simple animation and controller input in UF on uxn.  Licensed under 0BSD as this is far from a proper library, but somebody might find this useful as an example for other uxn/UF projects.

> This project runs on the [uxn/varvara virtual machine](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html) using Felix Winkelmann's excellent [UF](http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/uf/uf.html) Forth implementation.

## Prerequisites

- The [uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html) toolchain
- [UF](http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/uf/uf.html), version 8
